# RAG-CRICKET 🏏

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system applied to the cricket domain. It enables question answering by retrieving relevant cricket-related documents using vector similarity search and generating accurate, context-aware answers using a language model.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implements **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for cricket-based question answering  
- Retrieves relevant information using embeddings and a vector database  
- Uses a language model to generate grounded responses  
- Fully implemented in a **Jupyter / Google Colab notebook**

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- LangChain  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Sentence Embeddings  
- Vector Store (FAISS or similar)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess cricket-related text data  
2. Generate embeddings from documents  
3. Store embeddings in a vector database  
4. Retrieve top relevant documents based on the user query  
5. Generate an answer using a language model with retrieved context  


## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `RAG(CRICKET).ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter  
2. Install the required libraries (as mentioned in the notebook)  
3. Run all cells sequentially  
4. Enter cricket-related questions in the query section  

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
- Clear understanding of **RAG architecture**  
- Hands-on experience with embeddings and vector similarity search  
- Practical usage of LangChain pipelines  
- Improved accuracy of LLM responses using retrieval
